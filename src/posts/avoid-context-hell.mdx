excerpt: One of the rule to optmize context api performance is to split make them small. This can be translated in a bigger amount of smaller contexts, and just like that, you will end up with the Context pyramid of hell.

There is a trend about replacing state management libraries with React Context api. [Please not][].

But even when you don't use it like this, it's likely you end up with something like this:

```
const Main = () => (
  <ContextProviderOne>
    <ContextProviderTwo>
      <ContextProviderThree>
        <ContextProviderFour>
          <ContextProviderN>
            <App />
          </ContextProviderN>
        </ContextProviderFour>
      </ContextProviderThree>
    </ContextProviderTwo>
  </ContextProviderOne>
)
```

Because one of the rule of React Context api performance is to split contexts in much smaller contexts, holding atomic values whenever you can, you will end up having what I call context pyramid of hell. Lets admit it, this is not pleasant. But there is a better way to work with multiple Contexts using composition.

Creating a helper function that composes multiple Providers and returns a single Provider component we can improve our context management:

```
const composeProviders = (...providers) => ({ children }) => {
  return providers.reduceRight(
    (child, Provider) => <Provider>{child}</Provider>,
    children
  )
}
```

Using `reduceRight` allows us to keep the herarchy between context providers.

The way to use this helper would be like this:

```
const Providers = composeProviders(
  ContextProviderOne,
  ContextProviderTwo,
  ContextProviderThree,
  ContextProviderFour,
  ContextProviderN
);

const Provider = ({ children }) => <Providers>{children}</Providers>;

export default Provider;
```

As you see, the result is the same but the code is cleaner and much readable.
