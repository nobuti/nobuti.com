`useReducer` is a hook from React, similar to `useState` but gives you more control to manage the state. It takes a reducer function and initial state as arguments and returns the current state and method to update the state:

```
const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducerFn, initialState)
```

This is a pattern taken from the Redux, that's why the updater function is usually called `dispatch`. The reducer function is a pure function that takes the current state and the action as arguments and returns the new state:

```
(prevState, action) => newState
```

Most of the time, the action is an object with a `type` property, but it can be anything. This is why it is a more superior way to handle the state than `useState` because it gives you more control over the state and it's more predictable.

Using `useReducer` as replacement of `useState` it is as easier than grouping multiple related `useState` hooks into a `useReducer`:

```
// Separated useState hooks
const [words, setWords] = useState(0);
const [author, setAuthor] = useState('');
const [title, setTitle] = useState('');
const [updatedAt, setUpdatedAt] = useState();

// Single useReducer hook
const [book, updateBook] = useReducer((state:State, payload:Partial<State>):State => {
  return {
    ...state,
    ...payload
  }
}, { words: 0, author: '', title: '', updatedAt: undefined });
```

To update the book state, you can use the `updateBook` function, and unlike `useState` you can pass an object with multiple properties to update at once:

```
updateBook({ words: 1000, author: 'David' });
```

The `useReducer` hook is a great way to centralize the state management and ensures the data integrity easier no matter where the update state function is called from:

```
const [book, updateBook] = useReducer((state, payload) => {
  const newState = {
    ...state,
    ...payload,
    updatedAt: new Date()
  }

  newState.author = newState.author.trim();
  newState.title = newState.title.trim();

  return newState;
}, { words: 0, author: '', title: '', updatedAt: undefined });
```

I know you all love your useStates, but let's admit it, `useReducer` is better, in fact `useState` is a simplified `useReducer` as technically it is `useReducer` under the hood.
