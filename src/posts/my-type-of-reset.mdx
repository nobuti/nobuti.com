First of all, is css reset still needed in 2019? I actually think it never has been necessary. But a CSS reset will help you to make your project maintain the look and feel between every browser and might save you a lot of time of browser-testing and debugging.

Along these years, a lot of options have emerged for reseting styles, being [reset.css][] or
[normalize.css][] the most popular. I love minimal CSS reset especially now that browsers are
getting more consistent with behavior. So I'm using my own reset file, customized to my needs.
In this article, I want to share these preferences with you.

### Box sizing

I set `box-sizing` on the html and let elements inherit the property value. By this way you can set a default `box-sizing` but still able change the behaviour when you need it.

```
html {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
*,
*:before,
*:after {
  box-sizing: inherit;
}
```

### Lists

I use unordered lists in many situations, and I don’t need a `disc` style in most of them. Here, I set `list-style` to none. Also, related to the next section, I remove the default `padding`.

```
ul,
ol {
  padding: 0;
  list-style: none;
}
```

### Spacing

Browsers set different spacings for different elements but I'd rather to manage margins by my own.

```
body,
h1,
h2,
h3,
h4,
h5,
h6,
p,
ul,
ol,
li,
figure,
figcaption,
blockquote,
dl,
dd {
  margin: 0;
}
```

### Images and videos

I let these elements conform to the width of their containers. Also setting these elements to `display: block` gets rid of an unwanted whitespace at the bottom of the element.

```
img,
video {
  height: auto;
  max-width: 100%;
  display: block;
}
```

### Form inputs

Somehting that always bugged me of form elements is that they don't inherit the container's font. So
no more.

```
input,
button,
textarea,
select {
  font: inherit;
}
```

### Iframe

I tried to avoid `iframe` as much as I can, so removing the border when I can't is nice.

```
iframe {
  border: 0;
}
```

### Tables

Working with tabulated data is likely to happen in any project these days. Setting the baseline and
keep it simple is the goal.

```
table {
  border-collapse: collapse;
  border-spacing: 0;
}

td,
th {
  padding: 0;
}

td:not([align]),
th:not([align]) {
  text-align: left;
}
```

### Body

I'm being totally opinated here. It’s useful for the `body` to fill the viewport, even when empty, so I do
that by setting the `min-height` to `100vh`. I also like smooth anchor scrolling, so I set
`scroll-behavior: smooth`, too. This is really handy combined with `scrollIntoViewport`. To improve
the font performance, `text-rendering: optimizeSpeed` instead of `optimizeLegibility`, and increse
the text legibility (and accesibility) augmenting the `line-height`.

```
body {
  min-height: 100vh;
  scroll-behavior: smooth;
  text-rendering: optimizeSpeed;
  line-height: 1.4;
}
```

### Styled components

To be honest, I was skeptical, I like CSS! But once I tried, I felt in love. In essence, styled components are easy-to-make react components you write with the [styled-components][] library where you can style your components with plain CSS inside your javascript code. For my use case, working mostly on React projects.

That’s it, a very tiny reset for styled-components that makes my life easier. If you like it, go to grab it from [GitHub][styled-reset] or [NPM][styled-reset-npm].
